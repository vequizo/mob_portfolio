		<p>I attended my first three years in primary school here in Puerto Elementary School and as for why here when
			its far away from my home? well my mother is a teacher and she's assigned here to work at this city school
			and she enrolled me here to study and be here with her and the rest is history</p>

		<h1>San Antonio Elementary School</h1>
		<p>I attened my last three years and graduated my primary education here in San Antonio Elementary School, as
			for why now? We'll me and mom are tired of commuting everyday to school and the ever worsening traffic in
			the city and the fact that she got reassigned in the countryside fueled our deciscions to finish my primary
			education here.</p>

		<h1>Saint Mary's Academy of Jasaan</h1>
		<p>I attended and graduated my secondary education in a private school called Saint Mary's Academy of Jasaan.
			The school was a religous institution teaching students an extra subject about "Christian Living" but
			honestly I never wanted to study here at first since well its a private school plus being expensive when its
			comes to tuition fees and whatnot but my mother dreamed of sending her child(me) to study here and I've
			literally no choice but to study here.</p>

		<h1>St Rita's College of Balingasag</h1>
		<p>I attended and graduated my senior high school at St Rita's College of Balingasag. I attended this school
			because of my mother's wishes and the scholarship offered by the school is good in her eyes. It took a while
			for me to adjust studying and going there as its like a city in terms of busyness there. The school offered
			intersting subjects like robotics, job immersion, programming but covid came and well we really didnt get to
			do more of it and also because I didnt got the oppurtunity of going on a senior high graducation, the best
			we at that time is a online graduation ceremony which hoenestly sucks a bit</p>
