			<p>As you may have notice at the side bar, its all about video games. Thats because I'm a lazy person at
				heart and I get too tired and sweaty easily doing physical activities which I dislike a lot, so I rather
				stay at home and binged play my favorite games.</p>
			<p>A hobby is supposed to be an activity, interest, or pastime that is undertaken for pleasure or
				relaxation, done during one's own leisure time and as you can see this is the stuff I do whenever I have

			<p>As you can me there's only few games listed down here because of two reasons which is first of not having
				a good personal computer(PC) and that force to play outside and go to Internet Cafe's and the second one
				is that I no longer have that much free time ever since I start college studies which is a damn shame.
			</p>
			<p>The games that I listed down at the sidebar is the only games I've played whenever I have free time which
